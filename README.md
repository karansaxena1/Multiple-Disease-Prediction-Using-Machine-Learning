## 🩸 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction 🏥

### 📌 Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease is a condition in which the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste properly. Early detection can prevent severe complications. This model helps predict CKD based on clinical and lab test parameters.

### 🗂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Blood Pressure (bp) 📉**
- **Specific Gravity (sg) 🧪**
- **Albumin (al) ⚖️**
- **Sugar (su) 🍭**
- **Red Blood Cell Count (rbc) 🩸**
- **Serum Creatinine (sc) 🧫**
- **Hemoglobin (hemo) 🩸**

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈

### 🚀 Model Performance
- **Accuracy: ~95%** 🎯
- **Precision & Recall: Optimized for early-stage CKD detection** ✅
